# If more than one adapter is found, an exception will be raised, since the
# ultimate purpose of this script is to help generate a database.yml. Our
# assumption is that something weird is going on if there is more than one
# adapter gem listed in the Gemfile, so we throw up our hands.

# *Note that this evaluates the Gemfile as a ruby script, so it's possible
# for someone to do something nasty in this file*
